The joy of the future? In early January, my thoughts turn toward the early signs of new life - hyacinth or crocus pushing through the snow like beacons of hope sprouting up everywhere. They are not here yet, but they will be, probably in just over a month. Phew. Also in just over a month, we will be staring down Valentine’s Day - the next acceptable holiday for us to go crazy with the chocolate and cookies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valentine’s Day really marks the start of the hopeful season. Those buds we only dream of today are popping up all over. The bright spots of color from those hearty flowers can’t quite match the bright spots of our loved ones. We warm up with the joy and pleasure of those we love. And it isn’t only about romantic love. Women have adopted the day to celebrate friendship and find reasons to be silly instead of sappy with the twin holiday - Galentine’s Day. Either way, this mid-February holiday is what you make it and we suggest you make it enjoyable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the year we have just had, Valentine’s Day gifting could go one of three ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-double-down-on-normalcy-and-tradition&quot;&gt;1. Double down on normalcy and tradition.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. We miss that don’t we? Can we please have something be like it always was? And, things don’t become beloved traditions by chance (or do they?) The top three traditional gifts are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cards&lt;/strong&gt;: you can make one yourself or grab a beautiful one from a local store or an artist directly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chocolates&lt;/strong&gt;: truffles, milk chocolates, those mystery boxes, or even a cocoa bomb - cocoa and marshmallows in a chocolate shell.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;flowers&lt;/strong&gt;: pick out a beautiful bouquet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wine&lt;/strong&gt;: …wait - isn’t that 4 things? while it didn’t make the top three, wine is absolutely a fine traditional gift for Valentine’s Day! Especially if you plan to share your time and enjoy a glass with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-throw-tradition-to-the-wind-and-give-a-small-gift-they-can-enjoy-right-away-thinking-of-you&quot;&gt;2. Throw tradition to the wind and give a small gift they can enjoy right away thinking of you.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find these in gift shops or even from your neighbor down the street.  If you want to skip the traditional gift, we suggest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terrarium kits or seeds&lt;/strong&gt;: We are already thinking about plants, why not gift them?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work bag or lunch box&lt;/strong&gt;: Returning to the office (maybe) is going to be like the first day of school, so make it count!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self care kit&lt;/strong&gt;: It is still winter after all. Help them nourish their beautiful skin and stay warm! Think of luscious lathery shave bars, relaxing bath bombs, super soft fabric eye pillows, and small batch coffee and teas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home items&lt;/strong&gt;: They’ve been looking at the same stuff for awhile. Enliven their little cave with a cute sign, funny mug, or pictures of you together in a one of a kind frame!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-give-them-the-gift-of-time&quot;&gt;3. Give them the gift of time.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect approach if you’re working on a no spend challenge or just trying to clean up your finances. Here are a few ideas from us to get your brain juices flowing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a great meal together&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grab some marshmallows and have a back yard campfire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sit outside and wonder at the stars&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pop some popcorn and enjoy a movie at home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go for a nice run or walk together&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jump in the car and drive out to an open park or lake to enjoy nature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Play your favorite tunes and have a dance party&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Face time or zoom while you eat dinner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And will you look at that - three kinds of ways to make Valentine’s Day (or Galentine’s Day) special. If you want to send a gift but don’t want to search for one or worry about shipping, Gifts-Done is here to help. One of our small business partners will deliver a gift from you within your budget, personalized just for your special someone based on the things you tell us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gifts Done</name><email>hello@gifts-done.com</email></author><category term="tips" /><category term="gifts" /><summary type="html">Double down on normalcy or throw tradition to the wind</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">National Grandparents Day</title><link href="http://blog.gifts-done.com/grandparents-day/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="National Grandparents Day" /><published>2019-08-25T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-08-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://blog.gifts-done.com/grandparents-day</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.gifts-done.com/grandparents-day/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grandparents Day is September 8, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love your grandparents? We do. &lt;em&gt;Our grandparents are the best!&lt;/em&gt; How awesome is it to find out that there is a day set aside to celebrate them? That’s right, every year on the 1st Sunday after Labor Day we honor the role grandparents play in our lives. I mean, without them, we would not be here - right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you show your appreciation?&lt;/strong&gt; Honestly, the best gift of all is your time. Go see them, cook a meal, play some games, listen to their stories, and be in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t be there with them on Sunday, why not send them a little something to show how much they mean to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is our list of the top 3 best gifts for National Grandparents Day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-gift-card-book&quot;&gt;1. Gift Card Book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put together a book gift cards for all the places they love to go. You could use a photo book with the gift card on one side and a picture or story from a time you were with them there on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-future-time-plan&quot;&gt;2. Future Time Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send out a hand written invitation to spend time with you in the future. Depending on their interest and your time, the invitation could include tickets to a ball game, movie passes, or even a weekender bag for a get away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-pictures&quot;&gt;3. Pictures!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right - slap pictures of the grandkids or great-grandkids on a mug, a puzzle, or in a cute frame. They love having you close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you’re too busy, sometimes you just can’t find the right thing, and sometimes you
just need a little help. That’s where we come in. Put in your giftee, set a price range, and curate
the perfect gift today in as little as 5 minutes. You got it. #AutomatedGifting #GiftsDone&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gifts Done</name><email>hello@gifts-done.com</email></author><category term="tips" /><category term="questions" /><category term="gifts" /><summary type="html">How to celebrate grandparents?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">No Waste Wrapping</title><link href="http://blog.gifts-done.com/no-waste-wrapping/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="No Waste Wrapping" /><published>2018-08-10T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-08-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://blog.gifts-done.com/no-waste-wrapping</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.gifts-done.com/no-waste-wrapping/">&lt;p&gt;Wrapping paper can really make the gift sparkle and stand out. There are so many choices in the stores, and you can even custom order your own. Paper for any occasion or preference is out there for us. We (all of people) seem to like it. And why not, it sure is pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to research from Hallmark, Americans spend approximately $3.2 billion a year on wrapping paper and bags.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because it is so pretty, we use a lot of wrapping paper - and what do we do with it? For the most part, we throw it in the trash. Anyone else save wrapping paper and tissue and bags and all of that? My hand is up, but the stash does not always fit what you need to wrap. And that is when we need to reach for a roll or flat of wrapping paper, a bag, or find an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or, I guess we can just give the gift unwrapped?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, no. The thing is, we don’t just want to hand over a thing. Presentation is part of it. There is a thrill that goes along with the uncertainty - the not knowing - the mystery that is in the wrap. &lt;strong&gt;Right?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-i-use-instead-of-gift-wrap-and-bags-to-present-gifts&quot;&gt;“What can I use instead of gift wrap and bags to present gifts?”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go: 8 alternatives that are awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-newspaper&quot;&gt;1. Newspaper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newspaper is perfect for wrapping. It looks good in large and small packages, and the words do not matter. The comics, games, and weather sections offer color and variety. We love how easy it is to work with newspaper. Newspaper is also a useful stuffing material for other wrapping methods - both shredded and balled. Note: you may be able to get blank newspaper ends from a local paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-paper-bags&quot;&gt;2. Paper bags&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper bags are slightly less easy than newspaper and may be more readily available - depending on your reading and shopping habits! Cut or pull the seams to get a flat piece of bag for wrapping or use the bag as is and stuff with a soft material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-fabric-shopping-bags&quot;&gt;3. Fabric shopping bags&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I somehow end up with more of these reusable bags than I need - all the time. Grocery chains give them out, they come with your race packets, and they are very affordable should you want to buy them. We like to give them as is and stuff, so the giftee can use the bag if they like, but I’ve also seen the bags cut and folded as wrapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-food-storage-containers&quot;&gt;4. Food storage containers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of wrapping with something that can be reused, why not use some plastic or glass storage containers. Storage containers are useful and solid enough for gifting. You can find them pre-printed in many designs, or use the plain ones and line the inside with butcher or parchment paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-maps&quot;&gt;5. Maps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember maps? Like, actual real paper maps you could trace your finger on? They are out there, collecting dust, in houses everywhere. Be brave, rip or cut maps out of old atlases and travel books or unfold those complex puzzles. The colors and designs are mesmerizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-your-drawingsor-your-kids-drawings&quot;&gt;6. Your drawings…or your kid’s drawings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone with kids knows that they will make at home and also bring home ample artwork. It does not all fit on the fridge, and most of it is not museum quality. Fun art is perfect for wrapping, though. If you don’t have kiddos or you just want to take a go of it yourself, you can draw on butcher paper, drawing paper, or just about any paper that you have around. Not just drawing but also stamping or painting will work to bring a little spark and interest to the gift. Two notes of caution: &lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt; construction paper is too inflexible to make a good wrapping material for most items - you can make it work if you are very gentle and &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; plain white printer paper is generally see through - try a heavier paper or multiple layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-mugs-or-mason-jars&quot;&gt;7. Mugs or mason jars&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small items fit so nicely inside of mugs. You can purchase mugs at just about any home goods or thrift store, get custom mugs from a local maker, paint to personalize yourself at a pottery shop, … or make them yourself if you have that kind of skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-clothing&quot;&gt;8. Clothing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are gifting clothing, you can use it, inside out, to wrap itself or an accompanying gift. This works best with sturdy items that are unlikely to rip or stain, like colored T-shirts - which happen to be very popular gifts. You can use scrap fabric in a similar way - fleece is great for wrapping!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not opposed to wrapping paper - it is beautiful and flexible and well suited to its purpose. You can do what works best for your gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let us know if you have another great wrapping alternative!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Parents, kids, and teachers are all in the thick of it. They are out buying boring things from lists, things they need, sometimes things that they don’t even want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-short-back-to-school-gift-idea-list&quot;&gt;Our short back to school gift idea list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make the whole thing just a little tiny bit better with the simplest of things. Here are five fun ideas to bring joy back to school for kids and teachers (and maybe other peoples).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-silly-erasers&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Silly erasers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands down, the biggest hit with all ages is erasers. Don’t go crazy - no one can use 300 erasers. A couple of well chosen ones may seem like an insignificant thing in the moment, but will be used and enjoyed many, many times. There are eraser sets for just about any taste out there, but you can’t go wrong with cute animals or puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-smelly-anything&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Smelly anything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember scratch and sniff stickers? They are still cool. Kids and grownups love them so. There are now also smelly pencils and markers. The markers are easiest to find but likely get the least amount of use - we just don’t have occasion to marker all the time. A fun smelling pencil can be a joy to a kid - or coffee scented for the teachers. It’s all in good fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-not-your-average-notebooks&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Not your average notebooks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. Not the plain ones. A nice weird notebook. One with brightly colored paper, dotted, or even blank sheets. A notebook with a lock or a super fun feely cover. These are the notebooks that become journals, artbooks, screenplays, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-key-chains&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Key chains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key chains are fun for keys, sure, but they are also fun for bag decorations. Help your favorite soon to be in school someone with a bag bauble. Personality matches are certainly a plus here. Personally, I have a guitar playing horseradish, and it makes me super happy, but that isn’t for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-washi-tape&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Washi tape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit more trendy than our typical gift advice, washi tape is small designer masking type tape that is perfect for adding flair to notes, journals, and decorating things. “Washi” means “Japanese paper” but the tapes, even from Japan, are masking tape - the most popular brand is MT, but there are so many different styles and colors. Even a plain roll can be put to good use in personalizing a binder or book cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you get all As!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gifts Done</name><email>hello@gifts-done.com</email></author><category term="tips" /><category term="gifts" /><summary type="html">Even if you are not in school, the back-to-school vibe gets you.

Do you love summer? We’ve been chatting up our friends and scrolling through Instagram, of course, to find a few fun summer gifts. Give them to yourself or someone else for whatever occasion inspires you this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-short-summer-gift-idea-list&quot;&gt;Our short summer gift idea list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t even have to buy all of this cool stuff. We don’t link to shops or specific items because we think you can handle that part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-homemade-popsicles&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Homemade popsicles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously - the probability that someone will turn down a homemade popsicle is approximately &amp;lt; 1%. That’s a totally scientific number that we made up, but we are pretty sure it is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make popsicles your own by following one of these three approaches to make the stuff to pour into your popsicle molds, or Dixie cups if you are really fancy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blend milk and fruit - we use coconut milk and/or heavy cream to get extra fun creaminess&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make pudding - people love pudding pops - by people, we mostly mean kids&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go with straight juice - these are super sweet - we cut ours with water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-shell-or-rock-art&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Shell or rock art&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom make a thing with some items you collect while out exploring (note, the real gift here is that you get to go exploring to get the things! - we are so sneaky).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collect small shells or rocks at the beach - not if you are in a leave no trace kinda place - and glue or paint them to make a friend’s name or a frame for a picture of you together. It will hold up for years as a memory of your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-yard-games&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Yard games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are partial to cornhole and horseshoes because they don’t take a great amount of effort and are portable. Go ahead and gift yourself a yard game and then invite everyone over to play…again and again. It is joy on repeat to gather friends and family together. Serve up some of those popsicles!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-custom-insulated-drinkware&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Custom insulated drinkware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know how you want your iced drinks, well, iced? Your friends and family do, too! You can be the person who sets everyone up with insulated drinkware with a favorite saying, joke, image, or just a name. We know there are so many makers who do this sort of thing; you can probably find one in your neighborhood. Celebrate the gift of cold!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-waterproof-fold-or-roll-up-mats&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Waterproof fold or roll up mats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be ready for an impromptu picnic, time at the beach, or a nap in the woods with a mat that will shield you from damp ground, bugs, and/or spiky plant parts. These mats roll or fold up, so you can just keep one in your car or go bag and bust it out in a time of need. Any time can be outside time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you have a splendid summer!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gifts Done</name><email>hello@gifts-done.com</email></author><category term="tips" /><category term="gifts" /><summary type="html">We love summer.

&lt;p&gt;Like, right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel tense, overwhelmed, nervous, or uncomfortable, it may be time to take a self-care break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we love you, we spent a few minutes coming up with a list of 22 ideas for self care. You can try these as written or build on them to come up with something that is just right for you. Don’t let our ideas hold back your creativity and expression!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A little tip - research shows that little doses of self care are critical to mental health and wellness. Constantly feeding ourselves with treats and rewards can be hazardous to that same mental health. Please self-care responsibly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gifts Done</name><email>hello@gifts-done.com</email></author><category term="life" /><category term="selfcare" /><summary type="html">How are you feeling?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Healthy Summer Snacks</title><link href="http://blog.gifts-done.com/healthy-summer-snacks/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Healthy Summer Snacks" /><published>2018-06-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-06-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://blog.gifts-done.com/healthy-summer-snacks</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.gifts-done.com/healthy-summer-snacks/">&lt;p&gt;Summer food can be the tastiest - barbecues, ice cream, sno cones, fair food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But our tasty treats usually take hours to prepare and are not all that healthy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the conundrum with summer. We want to be healthy and have the energy to spend all day outside, and we also want to enjoy tasty stuff. Our sugar loving brains may be crying out for a trip to the ice cream parlor, but our wallets and future selves want us to make other choices. While we are no experts on food here, we have spent years with this very same problem. Over the years, we’ve been able to come up with some tricks for healthy summer snacks that keep us (and our families) going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prepare-ahead&quot;&gt;Prepare ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often want to run out of the house for a day at the lake, beach, mountain, and it would never happen if we needed to stop along the way to pick up snacks. Mostly because we would faff the day away planning out when and where we would eat next. As time has passed, we’ve found some tried and true snacks that we just keep on hand ready to go out with whoever is going. Most of these are not seasonal (because fresh fruit and what not is all at risk of being smooshed). The gist is buying in bulk stuff that you will eat and then splitting it up into single servings immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trail-mix&quot;&gt;Trail mix&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granola, hippie food, whatever. A mix of nuts or nuts and fruit or nuts and chocolate can really make the day go by easier. Not only does it keep well, but it is light and does not require sitting down in a dry place. The varieties of mixes that you can put together are endless. Ours goes really fast when we make a special batch of honey or cinnamon nuts in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jerky-or-dried-meats&quot;&gt;Jerky or dried meats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dried foods last forever (or at least seem to) if you can avoid noshing them up. Dried meats especially can pack a protein filled punch for the adventurous. There are so many premade varieties in the store, but most of those are so expensive and so limited in flavor - admittedly, this seems to be getting better. You can make jerky in a warm oven with thinly sliced meats - marinate in your favorite flavors to shake things up. We like to go with combinations of spicy and peppery, and every once in awhile, sweet barbecue - surprisingly good on turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;salad-it-up&quot;&gt;Salad it up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joking aside, summer is a great time for salad. The greens just keep growing, and you can get lettuces and cabbages for cheap (or for the effort of growing them). We so, so, so recommend keeping some meats leftover from barbecues to use in salad in the coming week. This works, we promise - even teenage boys* are happy to eat steak salad. (&lt;em&gt;and aren’t they a hard to please bunch&lt;/em&gt;) The trick we use here is to not have the same salad every time. So, one day, we have egg salad with ripe grape tomatoes, and we won’t serve that one again for awhile - taco salad (with no silly shell) anyone? It’s as simple as trading out traditional dressing for salsa and ensuring you have limes and avocado on hand. Here are 13 salads for the 13 weeks of summer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;egg salad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;steak salad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;taco salad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cobb salad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strawberry salad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;beet salad (check out how the New Zealanders do this)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coleslaw&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;teriyaki chicken salad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;caesar salad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;corn salad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;melon salad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;potato salad (&lt;em&gt;you knew we would sneak that in&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;barbecue chicken salad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cook-in-batches&quot;&gt;Cook in batches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one wants to heat up the house in the summer. That’s why we are out grilling and busy noshing on salad, right? But some things we do want to cook, and we might want to do it in the house. We try batch cooking items that keep pretty well, so that we can get by with the least amount of artificial house heating as possible. You may have different things that you use a lot, but we go through so many eggs, chicken, and potatoes (pretty much every kind) that these get special treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eggs&quot;&gt;Eggs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We boil eggs by the dozen, often two dozen, and keep them in the fridge for eating as is - what is simpler than a boiled egg? or turning into deviled eggs or egg salad in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chicken&quot;&gt;Chicken&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bake and saute chicken in several pound batches to have different flavors on hand for sandwiches and salads. It is so much easier to just do it all at once than to cook chicken a couple of times per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;potatoes&quot;&gt;Potatoes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We boil and bake potatoes in bunches - as much as we can fit - and then save the rest in the fridge and freezer. Potatoes keep very well, but we never really have to test it because they are so easy to eat hot or cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-crazy-with-the-berries&quot;&gt;Get crazy with the berries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berries are sweet and, freshly picked, embody summer’s promises. Early in the season, strawberries lead the way - flushing markets with their bright red skin. Cherries and blueberries follow with their deeper rich flavors. Then we get boysenberries, raspberries, blackberries, and more to take us through fall. The great thing about these berries is that they are tastiest right away, but somehow we can only eat so many. Go ahead, try to gorge yourself on berries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We like to pick berries and sometimes do the all you can eat while you are at the farm kinda thing. We also like the much easier option of picking up a pint or two at the market and using them right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-delicious-things-to-do-with-berries&quot;&gt;Three delicious things to do with berries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend the first one the most because it is the least amount of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat them as is&lt;/strong&gt;, as snacks in themselves, with granola/cereal, or on top of salads or yogurt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix them into stuff&lt;/strong&gt;. Not even kidding. Have you ever spread raspberry butter on a piece of toast - it’s amazing and just requires smooshing some raspberries into some softened butter. Also, the obvious - smoothies and milkshakes are better with berries. A few recipes:
  &lt;em&gt;Strawberry Banana&lt;/em&gt; 1 pint strawberries, 1 banana (preferably frozen), 2 cups milk (any kind)
  &lt;em&gt;Cherry Coconut&lt;/em&gt; 2 pints cherries, 1 can coconut milk (with cream)
  &lt;em&gt;Cloud Berry&lt;/em&gt; 3 pints berries (any kind), 1 cup iced cream, 1 cup whipping cream (or coconut cream)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can them&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, you knew we were going to suggest canning. You can make jam or jellies, or can them with framboise for an ice cream topper like no other. Who says you have to save your canned goods. Enjoy them now. Now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
