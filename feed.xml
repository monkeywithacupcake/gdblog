Never fear, there are rules for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“My friend gave me this beautiful vase, but it has been in my cupboard for a year, and I know another friend would actual use it. Is it okay to regift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I just received two different desk sets when I started a new job, and I can only use one. How do I use one and not hurt my other friend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions like these come up all of the time. While you may not have a beautiful gifted vase or two desk sets weighing you down, you may have faced a similar dilemma. The real issue is made more complicated by our competing wants. &lt;em&gt;We want to not waste things &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; we want to let people know we appreciate the gifts they give to us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing when and how to regift is more of an art than a science (or else, we would all just know what to do). Thankfully, there are rules that reduce the risk that your regifting will be either wasteful or hurtful. Follow these three rules and regift with confidence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-never-regift-to-the-gifter&quot;&gt;1. Never Regift to the Gifter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem obvious, but it is the most common rule broken in regifting. Why might that be so? Because we usually give people things that we find valuable or pleasing in some way. So, your friend Mary, who loves purple, may give you a purple kitten scarf because SHE thinks it is snappy and fun and look fabulous on you. If you look at it a few months later, you may think, *“hmmm, Mary would l-o-o-o-v-e that purple scarf, and I never wear it.” There are two ways to prevent this foible, one good, one less good. The first one we already wrote about - &lt;a href=&quot;/keep-gift-log/&quot;&gt;keep a log of what you get from everyone&lt;/a&gt;, and it is the best way to avoid regifting the gifter. The less good way is to work the gift item up into conversation and try to find out if they gave it to you. It is less good because it is hard to navigate this conversational mess and then turn around and give someone something. However, having an awkward conversation is still better than regifting to the gifter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-give-with-honesty&quot;&gt;2. Give with Honesty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are regifting, do not try to pretend that you have recently made or purchased the gift. You may not be caught in your lie, but it gains you nothing and risks the trust of your relationship. If the item has a tag, you can leave it on or remove it, depending on your preferences and how you are packaging. Being honest does not mean being annoyingly honest - You don’t have to come right out and say, “I got this thing and really don’t like it.” Feel confident enough to own the regift if your giftee recognizes the item or asks you directly. People appreciate honesty more than stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-be-thoughtful&quot;&gt;3. Be Thoughtful&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regifting is no different than gifting in this regard. You want to be thoughtful when gifting. Stop and think about the whole person before giving a gift - a poorly timed, presented, or considered gift can be worse than no gift at all. Being thoughtful does not mean that you will always get it right - you are not a mind reader and people are fallible. It is okay.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Thoughtful regifting can feel like it was just for you to begin with!&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I found a “Little Irish Birthday Book” on the clearance rack of the bookstore. The book was simply a list of every day that occurs in a year, so you can write a name. With this little book, my gift logging was born. I started entering in every person who I met. When I gave a gift, I would add an entry under their name with the year and what I sent and a smiley face if they liked it - &lt;em&gt;I did not realize I was ahead of my time with the whole emoji thing&lt;/em&gt;. I found out that it could only hold a few years of information and it had no good place for me to track what I was receiving, which I started to be curious about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the proliferation of smart things - phones, watches, lights, etc., we are logging more and more of our lives. If you keep up with bullet journalling, you may notice that people also track moods, sleep, instagram posts, and more. Applying the tried and true method of logging to gifting will, wait for it, change your life. I’m not kidding - rather than bore you with a litany of reasons why you should be logging your gifting, I’ll keep it to &lt;strong&gt;3 reasons you should be keeping a gift log&lt;/strong&gt; and then a quick &lt;strong&gt;How to keep a gift log&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-reasons-you-should-be-keeping-a-gift-log&quot;&gt;Three reasons you should be keeping a gift log&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-magnify-gratitude&quot;&gt;1. Magnify Gratitude&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping a log of things helps us not only to remember the past but also to be more aware of the present. I put this first because it is so powerful. It only takes a second to write down a description of what someone gave to you, just flip through your log (if you are keeping one) or put it in your journal. Research shows that we will be even more thankful if we write down specific things about the gift that we like - so, go crazy with the details!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-know-what-they-like&quot;&gt;2. Know What They Like&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, I gave a friend a funny joke mug that I thought she would like, but it turned out that she had a full set of pottery made by her grandfather and simply did not use any other dishes. That’s the kind of thing that you learn over time. I made a note in my book never to do it again. Another time, I found out about a baby shower a little late and ended up arriving only with some fancy chocolates for the Mom. She loved them so much that I gave her the same chocolates in different settings for the few years we lived close. Keeping track of what people do and do not respond to is helpful for you to make people happy. Also - making people happy makes us happy - it’s like a happy bouncy thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-never-repeat-a-gift&quot;&gt;3. Never Repeat a Gift&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever gotten the exact same set of cat stickers from someone two gifts in a row? No? Well, I have. It is weird because clearly you like cat stickers, &lt;em&gt;who doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; but maybe you didn’t use up the last roll yet! Don’t be that person. When you track what you gift someone, it is so easy to avoid this because you can see everything that you have ever gifted them. Some gifts are great for repeats, like coffee dates or movie tickets, but physical items are mostly good for one go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-keep-a-gift-log&quot;&gt;How to Keep a Gift Log&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can keep your gift log anywhere. I recommend a dedicated notebook. It can be a physical notebook or a digital one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s one way to set up your gift log notebook. First, count the number of pages and divide the total by 12, and the result is the number of pages per month (120 pages means 10 pages per month). You can write little page numbers in the bottom if you want to have an index, but then you need to subtract one from the total because it will be the index :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. I’d put a little labeled tab and the name of the month on the first page. I’d like to pretend it is all artsy, but I use block letters. After you label each month, you have 9 pages to work with. For most months, this will last years and years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just put in the person’s name and their birthdate, like “Amy (7/30)”. This starts Amy’s block. Generally, I put one person on a page to start a month. &lt;em&gt;If you have more than nine people you are giving gifts to, good for you!&lt;/em&gt; Under each name, just add a year and a description. In my example, Amy and I are just exchanging birthday gifts, but you can add little tags, like “Christmas” or “Nurses Day” to keep a more complicated log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”
― Maya Angelou&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think that a lot is communicated in how people feel, and &lt;strong&gt;we want people to feel joy&lt;/strong&gt;.  That’s not just a gimmick. We believe in self-care, family-care, friend-care. Here are 5 no cost ways to show people that you care and spread joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-invite-them-to-go-for-a-walk-with-you&quot;&gt;1. Invite them to go for a walk with you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;by Jonas Weckschmied, Unsplash&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1469989336803-8876b8443f06?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;s=40c67e788265b1f0dce05673e6bccfbc&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=400&amp;amp;q=60&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;
An invitation is a beautiful thing, regardless of its form. We feel included and may even do things that we want to do but avoid because of lack of motivation. Inviting a friend to walk with you may give them just enough reason to get up and do something they wanted to do anyways! In addition, walking with other people - socially - has been shown to reduce depression.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We all know that there are physical benefits as well, so go out and walk. Chat them up during the walk. It will do you both some good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-make-them-a-meal-or-treat&quot;&gt;2. Make them a meal or treat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;by Nordwood Themes, Unsplash&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1488045212212-a5b5b0f8d3fc?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;s=fc70649381f3806d32aa42a4fef3e009&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=180&amp;amp;q=60&quot; alt=&quot;cupcakes&quot; /&gt;
They say that the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach, but it is true for ladies and kids as well. Have you ever offered a cookie to someone and not made an instant friend? Don’t worry about appearance or amount, either. Real people know that it doesn’t matter to taste. It’s enough that you care. Secret tip - you can make yourself or your family a treat or meal and just increase the portions a little or double to share with someone else. Luckily, cooking for others benefits us, too. Studies show that people who are cooking or making things for others feel more confidence, feel happier, and feel stronger connections to the people who they are cooking for.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-create-something-for-them&quot;&gt;3. Create something for them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;by rawpixel.com, Unsplash&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1521623569012-4eb30b21369a?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;s=28ee2f63a210ba9ebacd002c1f7dbf8c&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=330&amp;amp;q=60&quot; alt=&quot;pencil ready&quot; /&gt;
You have talents that you may not yet know of. Try to draw a little doodle, write a poem, paint a tiny canvas, or make an origami frog. There are so many little creative possibilities. The thing is, it doesn’t have to be perfect. Your fingerprint ladybug may just crack them up in the moment - it may never end up in a museum, or even a permanent place on your friend’s wall or fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-give-them-a-call&quot;&gt;4. Give them a call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;by rawpixel.com, Unsplash&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519781916412-663d649a4359?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;s=d92c5bbab6ff94740dc373fda5bae067&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=270&amp;amp;q=60&quot; alt=&quot;man on phone&quot; /&gt; When was the last time that you called someone or received a call - not for scheduling a dentist appointment or something but to chat? It seems like a rare treat these days. Even if they cannot talk to you, hearing your voice fumbling through the voicemail or seeing a missed call can help someone feel loved. It is so easy. If you don’t have much time, that is fine - just politely hang up after a short discussion. Not sure how to start talking to someone after it has been awhile. Prepare ahead of time with a question or an invitation - do they know something that you could ask them about or could you get together in person?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-pay-them-a-real-complement&quot;&gt;5. Pay them a real complement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an every day option - you can give these out all the time. Strangers, friends, family - it does not matter. …but there is a reason that complement is qualified with ‘real’. People can usually tell when we are being, er, frivolous with our complements. Genuine appreciation of something that he or she did is so much more meaningful than calling out immutable things like appearance. Here are a few examples, “Wow, you have a way with words - I’d never have thought of, ‘witty-thing-they-said’“… “These ‘insert food/art product’ are divine. I am impressed with your ‘insert specific something’”. Secret tip - Practice with strangers if you are afraid of sounding like a robot around your friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great perk of all of these - science shows that giving benefits us even without expectation of getting something back. So, every effort to give someone else joy brings it back to you!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We want everyone to feel confident when first starting out with gifts-done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;registration&quot;&gt;Registration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gifts-done service is ready for you, with just your email and a password. You can get started in less than 10 seconds. Please pay attention to the email that you enter; you can reset your password through this email address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3mIm-XgHPQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you get with your registration? At no cost whatsoever, you can set up your giftees and identify their important dates. You can use that information for your own reference - and have it available all year ‘round. If you want to have us take care of your gifts - that’s the whole &lt;strong&gt;done&lt;/strong&gt; part of gifts-done - you can add payment information and then you just press “curate” on any of your gift events. We use your budget and your giftee preferences to send a great gift. Our service fee is charged when the gift is finished (along with the cost of the gift and shipping). You can also become a member and pay no service fees for an entire year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-a-giftee&quot;&gt;Setting up a giftee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who we want to send gifts to are called “giftees”. There is a section on your dashboard that always has a big button on the bottom, “Add a Giftee”. You can click that button and add information about these people. It takes just a minute to set someone up as a giftee. You will see the following fields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name&lt;/strong&gt; - this is the full name that would go on something you mail to this person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick name&lt;/strong&gt; - this is what you call them, like: Gramma, or Billy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they call you&lt;/strong&gt; - you may have different names for different people (their nick names for you)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their shipping address&lt;/strong&gt; - we ship to all US addresses - The most critical information about a giftee is the shipping address. &lt;em&gt;Please double check that it is correct.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their preferences&lt;/strong&gt; - this is all optional, but it helps us to better select a supplier and helps them to put together a great gift for this person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-a-gift-event&quot;&gt;Setting up a gift event&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gift event is a particular gift for a giftee. Typical gift events are recurring events, like birthdays, anniversaries, or holidays (Mother’s Day, Father’s Day), and one off events, like graduations or weddings. You set the date, a note, and a budget for each gift event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short video (40 seconds) shows creating a new gift event for one of your giftees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVXxf0BGR6Y&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a gift event and a payment method setup, you can click the ‘curate’ button. This puts your gift event in our list of gifts to send. If it is soon, we match you with a supplier right away. If it is far off, we keep track of the date until it is close enough to engage a supplier. We will ask you to verify the address again if it has been awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-dashboard&quot;&gt;Your Dashboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are logged in as a gifts-done supplier, you can see all of the gift events assigned to you and their status. Most of the time, you will get just over 30 days to make and deliver a gift. The due dates and target shipping countdown are clearly visible at the top of each gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;giftee entry form&quot; style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.gifts-done.com/assets/images/supplier_dashboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;supplier gifts-done dashboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;see-gift-details&quot;&gt;See Gift Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click on the details, you will see the gift budget, the note that should accompany the gift, the giftee preferences, and the address - all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;gift event details for a supplier&quot; style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.gifts-done.com/assets/images/supplier_event_details.png&quot; alt=&quot;gift event details gifts-done dashboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finish-a-gift&quot;&gt;Finish a Gift&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A finished gift is the best gift, right? Every gift event that is not already finished has “Mark As Finished” button. When you push that button, you are presented with the form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;gift event finish form&quot; style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.gifts-done.com/assets/images/supplier_finish_form.png&quot; alt=&quot;gift event finish form from gifts-done dashboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you finish a gift, you can double check the details, including the budget, note, and address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ship-a-gift&quot;&gt;Ship a Gift&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the charge is successful after you finish a gift, you will see a “Mark As Shipped” button. Otherwise, you will see a warning that the user could not be charged and you should not ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To identify something as shipped, just press “Mark As Shipped” and add the tracking number.

&lt;h1 id=&quot;picture-this&quot;&gt;Picture This&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two sisters live miles and miles apart, but chat frequently. Nearly every week, we spend time staring at each other and catching up on all of the exciting things (and real things) going on in our lives. Work, kids, weather, love, money, etc. One routine topic of conversation always had a pang of guilt, terrible guilt - and that was not sending gifts. We would even make plans…the kinds of plans that get down to discussing actual future actions - hey, Sara’s&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; birthday is next month - what are you going to send? &lt;em&gt;No matter how much we talked about being thoughtful, life and indecision held us up.&lt;/em&gt; We’d find cool stuff and bounce between ideas until it was too late to buy and ship. We’d ponder last minute options, like a grocery delivery. Ultimately, we’d just end up talking about what we did not send and how we would totally be better people for the next awesome person and remember to send something. &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say the first step to recovery is identifying that you have a problem. It was a summer day in 2017, and we were in our usual cycle of conversation when we stopped and reflected that the whole not-sending-gifts-that-you-mean-to-send is actually a problem. One of us mentioned that there should be a better way. Perhaps there were people who could just do it for you, so you wouldn’t have to be lame. Since we don’t live in a world where people just do things for us, we started looking for a gifting service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;by Aron Reacher, Unsplash&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501139083538-0139583c060f?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;s=d34293717666869c9f8d26d353e1bb24&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=300&amp;amp;q=60&quot; alt=&quot;hourglass&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what we found? Lots and lots of services to remind us of important dates. The more that we searched, and failed, the more that we worked to define the problem we actually faced. It wasn’t that we didn’t remember, it was that we’d remember at the wrong time or let the perfect gift be the enemy of the great gift. We ultimately found that what we really needed was a way to plan our gifting when we had time and we were thinking about it - any busy person knows that these two are rarely in line. And then, we needed a way to ensure that the gifts shipped not when we were thinking about them, but at the right time. It was all just a time/flow problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We thought it might be easier to bend space time than to get the timing right ourselves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-idea&quot;&gt;The Idea&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We let it go for awhile; mostly because bending space time seemed pretty hard. Then, it came back up in conversation - perhaps we could be the solution. Not that we, personally, could go out and make or get gifts for folks, but perhaps we could come up with a solution. We considered just outsourcing our whole list to some kind of magical people who would be better than us at gifting. We labored through how we would ensure that these magical people would get the kinds of gifts that would make us and our giftees happy. There seemed to be so many questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How we could trust them not to just go to Target and buy something off of the dollar shelf?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More deeply, how could we get the kinds of things and support the businesses we liked if we outsourced?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How would we keep track of what people got and whether they liked it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How would we know that people got different things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed like a no go. There were just so many risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we did the first thing that we should have done. We talked to people. We talked to lots of people. It was hard at first - did you know that people don’t like to admit that they struggle with things? However, most of our friends had the exact same struggles. Ultimately, we reached the people who make things and would turn out to be our solution. It turns out that so many people who are working at home or in small shops love when the orders that come in to them are gifts - and they love when orders come in at all because…let’s face it, being able to have a roof and food are nice. Maybe we could give some of our creative friends our list and just have them do it. Wait…that’s close. Maybe we could develop something up that would send our creative friends our request just at the right time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;by Bhushan Sadani, Unsplash&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1478088702756-f16754aaf0c4?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;s=82c573f4bc95aa283422fc036f16042d&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;q=60&quot; alt=&quot;magic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is when we really had it. And about the time that we realized that we could make this work for other people, too. We just needed to collect enough different creative people to be able to deliver gifts over the whole year to different kinds of people. And, we needed to have a way to collect and store information from people. From there, it was a coding journey and a little bit of a finance journey, as we picked a way to process payments that seemed the most fair to our users and suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, our gifts-done service is still this idea. People can enter information about their giftees, folks they want to send gifts to and the right dates and gift budgets for those people. Our service pays attention to the dates, budgets, and the preferences of the giftee and matches them up with a creative business owner who hand crafts or curates a gift that is sure to delight and sends it just on time. We added a part where the suppliers take a picture and describe what they are shipping as well. Now, we know what “we” are sending and can clue in our friends and family to expect something from us. It still feels a little bit like magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rarely does joy come out of guilt, but it does in this story.&lt;/p&gt;
